Hi there. 

I've been a basic vim user for quite a while now. I knew it was highly customizable and extensible but I didn't bother with it for anything more than simple edits. And then I saw how some folks were "power" using it and had one of those "This is cool!", "Damn! I didn't vim could do this!" moments. I decided to do something about it and thanks to the authors of the following resources, I've been working on boosting my vim :

Here's how you can play :  
* Clone this repo at a convenient location in your file system
* Run setup.sh
* Restart vim

Suggestions Welcome. Please open an issue.
